I'm a former soldier turned software developer, driven by discipline, curiosity, and a love for clean, efficient code.

### A Bit About Me:

- *Tech Stack*:  
  Python Flask JavaScript HTML CSS React.js Docker Git GitHub PostgreSQL  
- *Learning Goals*: I'm currently sharpening my full-stack development skills and exploring how to build scalable, secure SaaS applications.

### What Makes Me Different:
- I plan everythingâ€”Iâ€™m detail-oriented and mission-driven.
- I bring *military discipline* to team collaboration, code quality, and project execution.
- Fluent in *English, Swahili, Somali*, and intermediate Arabicâ€”great at working with global teams.
